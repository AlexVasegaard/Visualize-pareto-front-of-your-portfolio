# Visualize-pareto-front-of-your-portfolio
A very simple method but easily customizable code snippet to visualize the pareto front for different distributions of selected stocks. In effect, it could be used to check which modifications one could make to ones own portfolio in order for it to fit ones preferences in terms of expected return and risk. Taking on too much risk without gaining expected return is after all never a good deal.
